You will need:

+ A Raspberry Pi Pico
+ Two pin-socket jumper wires

Attach one pin-socket jumper wire to **GP18** and attach the other pin-socket jumper wire to the **GND** closest to it.

**Tip:** When you craft a switch you will stick the pin end of the jumper wire to a conductive surface, like copper tape or kitchen foil.
